### Hi, my name is Lucas Keiji Hori Rosa! 

On my Github Pages you'll find tutorials about using the BECKHOFF PC technology. <strong><ins> Note that this page isn't affiliated with BECKHOFF and MUST NOT be used as a documentation. For that, please refer to the official BECKHOFF webpage. </ins></strong>

All my content is free and the main goal is to provide TUTORIALS. If you plan to use ANY of it in production or application, it MUST be thoroughly tested before implemented (use the code at your own risk).
